## 🎯 How the Three-Agent System Works

### Development Phase
```
1. START FEATURE
   ↓
2. Use Backend Agent OR Frontend Agent
   "Create ticket check-in module"
   ↓
3. Agent helps you build
   - Generates code
   - Follows architecture
   - Includes tests
   ↓
4. CODE COMPLETE
```

### Review Phase
```
5. SELF-CHECK
   - npm run lint:check
   - npm run test:arch
   - npm run test:unit
   - npm run build
   ↓
6. Use Tech Lead Agent
   "Review this feature for:
    - Architecture compliance
    - Documentation alignment
    - CI/CD readiness"
   ↓
7. Tech Lead provides comprehensive review
   - Lists issues
   - Explains why each matters
   - Provides fixes
   - Educational feedback
   ↓
8. FIX ISSUES (if any)
   - Use Backend/Frontend agent
   - Update documentation
   - Re-test
   ↓
9. Ask Tech Lead to re-review
   ↓
10. APPROVED ✅
    ↓
11. Push & Create PR
    ↓
12. CI/CD PASSES (because Tech Lead ensured compliance!)
```

You: [In backend directory]
"Create a Payment processing module with:
- Domain: Order entity, Transaction value object
- Application: ProcessPaymentCommand with handler
- Infrastructure: PaymentController, PaymentRepository
- Events: PaymentCompletedEvent, PaymentFailedEvent
Follow hexagonal architecture."

Backend Agent: [Generates complete module structure]

# STEP 2: Frontend

## 🚨 Common Questions

### Q: Do I need all three agents?
**A:** Yes! They work together:
- Backend/Frontend agents BUILD features
- Tech Lead agent REVIEWS features
- Best results when used together

### Q: Which agent do I use for...?
**A:**
- Creating modules/components → Backend/Frontend agent
- Writing business logic → Backend agent
- Building UI → Frontend agent
- Code reviews → Tech Lead agent
- Architecture questions → Tech Lead agent
- Documentation verification → Tech Lead agent

### Q: Can Tech Lead help me build features?
**A:** Tech Lead CAN help build, but it's optimized for REVIEW. Use Backend/Frontend agents for building, then Tech Lead for reviewing.

### Q: What if agents disagree?
**A:** Tech Lead has final say (broader context). But also ask why they disagree - there may be a learning opportunity.

### Q: How do I improve the agents?
**A:** Edit the instruction files in `.github/`:
- Add new examples
- Update best practices
- Include team learnings
- Document edge cases
