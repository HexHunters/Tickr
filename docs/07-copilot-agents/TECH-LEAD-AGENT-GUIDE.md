## 🎯 Purpose

The **Tech Lead Agent** is your comprehensive code reviewer and architecture guardian. Unlike the Backend and Frontend agents that help you BUILD features, the Tech Lead agent helps you REVIEW and VALIDATE code before merging.

---

## 🤖 What Makes This Agent Special

### Complete Project Knowledge
- ✅ Knows entire backend structure (all 6 modules)
- ✅ Knows entire frontend structure (Next.js 16 App Router)
- ✅ Has read ALL documentation in `docs/` directory
- ✅ Understands complete CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Knows all 30 architecture fitness functions
- ✅ Understands team conventions and standards

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- ✅ Reviews architecture across backend AND frontend
- ✅ Verifies documentation alignment
- ✅ Checks CI/CD compliance
- ✅ Validates security practices
- ✅ Ensures performance optimization
- ✅ Maintains consistency across codebase

---

## 🚀 When to Use

### Use Tech Lead Agent For:

#### 1. **Final Code Reviews**
```
After backend/frontend agents helped you build:
→ Use Tech Lead agent to review before PR

"Review this code for architecture compliance, documentation 
alignment, and CI/CD readiness"
```

#### 2. **Architecture Validation**
```
When unsure if design follows principles:
→ Ask Tech Lead for architectural review

"Does this module structure follow our hexagonal architecture? 
Review against docs/03-architecture/"
```

#### 3. **Documentation Verification**
```
After making changes:
→ Verify docs are up-to-date

"Check if my code changes match the documentation in docs/. 
What needs updating?"
```

#### 4. **Cross-Module Integration**
```
When modules need to communicate:
→ Validate event-driven approach

"Review this cross-module communication. Am I using events correctly?"
```

#### 5. **Security Audits**
```
Before deploying sensitive features:
→ Get security review

"Security review: check input validation, authentication, 
and authorization in this payment flow"
```

#### 6. **Performance Review**
```
For high-traffic features:
→ Check performance implications

"Performance review: will this event listing page handle 
10,000+ events efficiently?"
```

#### 7. **CI/CD Pre-Flight**
```
Before pushing:
→ Verify will pass pipeline

"Will this code pass all CI/CD stages? Check against our pipeline."
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Complete PR Review
```
Chat: @workspace /context .github/copilot-instructions-techlead.md

I've implemented the ticket check-in feature. Please review:

1. Architecture compliance (hexagonal, CQRS, events)
2. Documentation alignment
3. Test coverage
4. CI/CD readiness
5. Security concerns
6. Performance implications

Files changed:
- backend/src/modules/tickets/domain/entities/ticket.entity.ts
- backend/src/modules/tickets/application/commands/checkin-ticket/

I need to add analytics tracking for every ticket purchase. 
Should I:
A) Import AnalyticsService in Tickets module
B) Publish a TicketPurchasedEvent for Analytics to listen
C) Something else?

Review against our architecture principles.

Agent Response:

## 🎓 Learning from Reviews

### Tech Lead Reviews Are Educational

Every review from the Tech Lead agent is a learning opportunity:

#### Example Learning Review:
```
You: "Review my event creation module"

Tech Lead:
✅ Architecture compliance: PASSED
   Great job keeping domain pure!

⚠️ Testing concern: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
   Missing integration tests for repository.
   
   Why this matters: Integration tests verify your TypeORM mapping
   works correctly with actual database.
   
   Add this test:
   [provides example]
   
   Learn more: docs/06-testing/03-backend-testing-guide.md

🟢 Documentation: GOOD
   API docs updated correctly.

💡 Suggestion: Consider extracting validation to Value Objects
   Example: instead of validating email in entity,
   create Email value object that validates on construction.
   
   See: docs/03-architecture/01-principes-hexagonaux.md (Value Objects)

✅ APPROVED with suggestions
```

## 💬 Best Practices for Working with Tech Lead

### 1. Be Specific
```
✅ GOOD: "Review payment processing for security, performance, 
         and architecture compliance"
❌ BAD: "Is this code ok?"
```

### 2. Provide Context
```
✅ GOOD: "This refund feature touches Payments and Tickets modules.
         Review cross-module communication via events."
❌ BAD: "Review this" [paste code with no context]
```

### 3. Ask for Learning
```
✅ GOOD: "Review this and explain why each issue matters"
❌ BAD: "Just tell me what's wrong"
```

### 4. Request Specific Checks
```
✅ GOOD: "Focus on security and performance, architecture looks good"
❌ BAD: "Review everything"
```

### 5. Iterate Based on Feedback
```
✅ GOOD: "I fixed the issues you mentioned. Can you re-review?"
❌ BAD: [Ignores feedback and merges anyway]
```
